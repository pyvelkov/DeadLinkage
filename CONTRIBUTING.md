## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
 - [Windows Terminal - up to date](https://github.com/lextm/windowsterminal-shell) is required as it supports ANSI colour codes.
 - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chrome/) must be installed as chromedriver relies on the Chrome Browser to send and test Get requests.
 - [Google-Java-Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/releases) the latest version must be downloaded in order to maintain the code style.
 - [SpotBugs](https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs/releases) the latest version must be downloaded in order to keep code clean and bug-free.

###### Optional
 - [Telescope](https://github.com/Seneca-CDOT/telescope) must be installed in order to use `-telescope` functionality of tool.

#### Running Tests Before Making a Commit

Before you contribute a commit to this repository, you must be sure that everything works how it is supposed to.
Although various tests and compilations are done when making a pull request to the master branch on this repo, it is highly recommended to run local tests as well.

In order to run local tests using maven the following can be done:

* Run all test classes in the project
 ```
 mvn test
 ```
 
* Run a single test class
 ```
 mvn -Dtest=LinkArgumentParserTest test
 ``` 
"LinkArgumentParserTest" is an example you can exchange with any new class created/existing. 

* Run a single test in a class
 ```
 mvn -Dtest=LinkArgumentParserTest#urlArgParser_noSpecifier test 
 ```
"#" specifies which test method you would like to run. You can exchange "urlArgParser_noSpecifier" with any method inside the specified class.
